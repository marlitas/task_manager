  <h1 class = 'heading'> About Task Manager</h1>
  <div class = 'welcomemenu'>
  <p> Task manager is a Ruby on Rails app that was guided by an exercise provided by Turing School of Software and Design. Marla A. Schulz then took the opportunity to add CSS, HTML, and additional Ruby customization to practice skills and further understand what Ruby on Rails combined with CSS/HTML can do. Task Manager is only set up to run on a local server, and uses PostgreSQL to handle database entries and queries.
